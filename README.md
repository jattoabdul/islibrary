Problem to be solved with the project: Illiteracy among Muslims of this age!

Purpose of project: In order to describe the purpose or the reason for which a project has been created, one must understand the problem no matter or tangential the knowledge of the problem may be to the problem itself. As stated above, the problem is illiteracy… By illiteracy I do not mean the lack of knowledge entirely! For today, a lot do have knowledge but few have the right knowledge. That’s why we have a rise in technological and life development while the moral development is being forgotten (for the more precise part, it has been left in the dust).  It is because many lack the knowledge of God, of Islam and of Sunnah of the Best of mankind – Muhammad (SAW); that’s why we do have radicals, terrorists, liars, imposters and all sorts of men who continually tarnish the image of the way of Allah (SWT). 

The Project: The project is simply an online library (a library module), where Muslims and others alike can find any Islamic book at all that they need, starting with the first Islamic Book, the best of Books (Al-Qur’an), then the Hadith Books (they also important books in Islam) and all other books which have been written by Islamic Scholars which are on the way of Allah (sibghotallah)… 

Users will be able to search for books, then wither download them or read them directly online (NOTE: all books are in PDF format). Users will be able to add their books in later dates. All books on the platform will be free and users will get library codes when they visit the website for the first time. With this library code, they can continually link other books to themselves which they can download on later dates… However, registration on the platform is absolutely needless!
